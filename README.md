This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to create an interactive chatbot that users can communicate with through a website. The RAG model enhances the chatbot's responses by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base before generating an answer, making interactions more informative and contextually accurate.
